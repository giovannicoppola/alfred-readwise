If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they\u2019ve never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else. Commonly, these will be things that other people want you to do, to make their lives easier, and which you didn\u2019t think to try to resist.

                "text": "In December 1868, at the St. Nicholas Hotel for a meeting with Thomson, Carnegie, who the month before had celebrated his thirty-third birthday, sat down with his stub-nosed pencil and a scrap of paper to take stock of his life\u2014and his finances. He tallied his current assets and income and then wrote himself a memo. His net worth, he discovered, was about $400,000 (close to $75 million today); his annual income in dividends over $50,000. If he carefully managed his assets over the next two years\u2014and stopped taking fliers on new investments\u2014he would, he estimated, be able to guarantee this level of income in the future. He resolved: \u201cBeyond this never earn\u2014make no effort to increase fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes. Cast aside business forever except for others.\u201d He had already sacrificed too much to the pursuit of wealth. Like other men, he realized that he had to \u201chave an idol,\u201d a god or goal to reach for. Until now, this \u201cidol\u201d had been \u201cthe amassing of wealth,\u201d which was, he recognized, \u201cone of the worst species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money.\u201d Having chosen his goal, he had been almost single-minded in its pursuit, unwavering, undeterred, inexorable in his movement forward. \u201cWhatever I engage in I must push inordinately,\u201d discarding all cares and concerns that might detour him. \u201cTo continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery.\u201d There was no self-pity here, no regrets. He was thinking only of the future. Three years earlier, he had contemplated retiring to Europe to pursue his own education, but he had spent only a year abroad. He had, since then, multiplied his fortune many times, but he had not proceeded very far in acquiring the cosmopolitan polish he lacked. He did not want to spend what remained of his life making stock deals and chasing bridge contracts. He was ready now to put aside moneymaking and choose a way of life \u201cwhich will be the most elevating in its character.\u201d He would devote the next two years to making money, while spending his \u201cafternoons in securing instruction, and in reading systematically.\u201d He would \u201cresign business at Thirty Five,\u201d then \u201csettle in Oxford & get a thorough education making the acquaintance of literary men.\u201d This, he estimated, would take him about \u201cthree years active work,\u201d during which he would \u201cpay especial attention to speaking in public.\u201d At age forty, he would take up his new life in earnest and \u201csettle then in London & purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review & give the general management of it attention, taking a part in public matters especially those connected with education & improvement of the poorer classes.\u201d16",

His pencil-written note was never, it appears, shared with family or friends. There is no mention of it in the Autobiography or any of his writings, nor is it included in the papers that were later donated to the Library of Congress.

                "text": "In addition to the two meanings suggested above, happiness has also been thought of as having a larger, almost spiritual quality that goes beyond both momentary feelings and reflective thought. Philosophers have talked about this third kind of happiness in terms of the fulfillment that comes from exerting the right kind of effort on the right kind of task (for you) or of experiencing a sense of deep connection to loved ones, nature, or the divine. The Hebrew word \u201csimcha\u201d has been used to capture this sense. There are many translations of this word into English, most of them related to ordinary feelings of happiness associated with celebratory events such as weddings or births. But one of my students told our class about an expanded definition used by Rabbi Akiva Tatz\u2014an Orthodox rabbi from South Africa\u2014that I like a lot. Simcha, Rabbi Tatz said, is \u201cthe experience of the soul that comes when you are doing what you should be doing.\u201d Simcha can encompass everything from taking time to comfort a sick friend to the joy of practicing your profession at a high level of skill. Positive psychologists have used words such as \u201cflow,\u201d \u201cflourishing,\u201d and \u201cmeaning\u201d to describe this deeper sense of happiness. The Greek word Aristotle used in his work The Nicomachean Ethics to describe this ultimate form of happiness was eudemonia\u2014which literally means \u201cspirit of goodness.\u201d",

And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be produced or developed. The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from this point of view. The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of premium, were unanimous on this point. Public opinion had been pronounced. The United States were the first in the field; and in New York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this narwhal. A frigate of great speed, the Abraham Lincoln, was put in commission as soon as possible. The arsenals were opened to Commander Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster did not appear.",

The magisterial poise of our style is a lie and a farce, our fame and social position are an absurdity, the public\u2019s faith in us is altogether ridiculous, the use of art to educate the nation and its youth is a reprehensible undertaking which should be forbidden by law. For how can one be fit to be an educator when one has been born with an incorrigible and natural tendency toward the abyss? We try to achieve dignity by repudiating that abyss, but whichever way we turn we are subject to its allurement. We renounce, let us say, the corrosive process of knowledge\u2014for knowledge, Phaedrus, has neither dignity nor rigor: it is all insight and understanding and tolerance, uncontrolled and formless; it sympathizes with the abyss, it is the abyss. And so we reject it resolutely, and henceforth our pursuit is of Beauty alone, of Beauty which is simplicity, which is grandeur and a new kind of rigor and a second naivet\u00e9, of Beauty which is Form. But form and na\u00efvet\u00e9, Phaedrus, lead to intoxication and lust; they may lead a noble mind into terrible criminal emotions, which his own fine rigor condemns as infamous; they lead, they too lead, to the abyss. I tell you, that is where they lead us writers; for we are not capable of self-exaltation, we are merely capable of self-debauchery. And now I shall go, Phaedrus, and you shall stay here; and leave this place only when you no longer see me.\u201d",

A lot of people who have read the novel think that Stoner had such a sad and bad life. I think he had a very good life. He had a better life than most people do, certainly. He was doing what he wanted to do, he had some feeling for what he was doing, he had some sense of the importance of the job he was doing. He was a witness to values that are important ... The important thing in the novel to me is Stoner\u2019s sense of a job. Teaching to him is a job\u2014a job in the good and honorable sense of the word. His job gave him a particular kind of identity and made him what he was ... It\u2019s the love of the thing that\u2019s essential. And if you love something, you\u2019re going to understand it. And if you understand it, you\u2019re going to learn a lot. The lack of that love defines a bad teacher ... You never know all the results of what you do. I think it all boils down to what I was trying to get at in Stoner. You\u2019ve got to keep the faith. The important thing is to keep the tradition going, because the tradition is civilization.",

It was a question, he suspected, that came to all men at one time or another; he wondered if it came to them with such impersonal force as it came to him. The question brought with it a sadness, but it was a general sadness which (he thought) had little to do with himself or with his particular fate; he was not even sure that the question sprang from the most immediate and obvious causes, from what his own life had become. It came, he believed, from the accretion of his years, from the density of accident and circumstance, and from what he had come to understand of them. He took a grim and ironic pleasure from the possibility that what little learning he had managed to acquire had led him to this knowledge: that in the long run all things, even the learning that let him know this, were futile and empty, and at last diminished into a nothingness they did not alter.",

We do not have the angry letter he sent Rush, but we do have the first of Rush\u2019s several apology letters, dated July 27, 1768. Rush downplayed the whole situation by not mentioning it until he had discussed other matters, including Morgan\u2019s advice about spending some time training in London hospitals before coming back to Philadelphia. Rush then began: I am sorry to find I have not followed the order in the names which you hint at, in the dedication of my thesis\u2026.I thought it a matter of no consequence. Dr. Shippen was my oldest friend and master, and this was the only reason why I put his name before yours\u2026.I hope therefore, my good friend, you will overlook my omission in placing your name after Dr. Shippen\u2019s. My thesis has been read, and is now I dare say forgot forever. No one will remember six weeks hence whose names were mentioned in my dedication.",

The expense of defending the borders was considerable; American wealth was substantial; and Edmund Burke made a compelling case in London for \u201cvirtual representation\u201d\u2014the argument that the king and Parliament were stewards of the whole empire whether particular colonists could vote for members of the House of Commons or not. So why did the colonists take such extreme steps\u2014arming themselves and putting their lives and their families\u2019 lives at risk? There is no single answer.29 The intellectual and political legacy of the English Civil War was vital, for it was both a beacon and a warning. John Locke and others articulated what became known as the liberal tradition\u2014the collection of insights and convictions that emphasized individual freedom in civic, economic, and religious life. The classical republican ethos that centered on virtue, harmony, balance, and fear of corruption had come to the Anglo-American world through Renaissance Florence, where Machiavelli and others sought to preserve the best of the ancient republics. The revivals of the First Great Awakening were critical, too, for the preaching of the mid-eighteenth century tended to focus on the centrality of the individual soul in relation to God. It was a Protestant movement, and for all its variations, Protestantism was largely about the importance of all believers, not the importance of priests and bishops and ecclesiastical systems. Then there was capitalism and its discontents. Americans were blessed with enormous natural resources and endless economic energy, yet many\u2014including Jefferson\u2014found themselves in perpetual debt to British creditors. Succeeding generations have sometimes tried to isolate one of these phenomena as the origin of the Revolution. It seems most convincing, though, to think of Lockean liberalism, classical republicanism (via the Renaissance), the Great Awakening, the promise of capitalism, and the hatred of debt (and the British merchants and banks who were owed the debts) as tributaries that all helped form the larger rushing river of the American Revolution. The debate over declaring independence took on such significance in part because a permanent break with London was not foreordained. For years colonists chose to believe that the monarchy was in the hands of nefarious, anti-American ministers. The hope from the 1750s to 1776 was that somehow the sovereign would put things to rights. It is a measure of the confidence Jefferson had in this possibility, for instance, that he maintained a tone of respect and deference to George III in his 1774 Summary View. And it is a measure of the depth of his sense of betrayal and disappointment in the king that the Declaration of Independence struck such virulent antimonarchical notes.",

I wished to make you sensible how imprudent it is to place your affections, without reserve, on objects you must so soon lose, and whose loss when it comes must cost you such severe pangs. Remember the last night. You knew your friends were to leave Paris today. This was enough to throw you into agonies. All night you tossed us from one side of the bed to the other. No sleep, no rest.\u2026 To avoid these eternal distresses, to which you are forever exposing us, you must learn to look forward before you take a step which may interest our peace. Everything in this world [is] a matter of calculation. Advance then with caution, the balance in your hand. Put into one scale the pleasures which any object may offer; but put fairly into the other the pains which are to follow, and see which preponderates. The making [of] an acquaintance is not a matter of indifference. When a new one is proposed to you, view it all round. Consider what advantages it presents, and to what inconveniences it may expose you. Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it. The art of life is the art of avoiding pain: and he is the best pilot who steers clearest of the rocks and shoals with which he is beset. Pleasure is always before us; but misfortune is at our side: while running after that, this arrests us. The most effectual means of being secure against pain is to retire within ourselves, and to suffice for our own happiness.\u2026 A friend dies or leaves us: we feel as if a limb was cut off. He is sick: we must watch over him, and participate of his pains. His fortune is shipwrecked: ours must be laid under contribution. He loses a child, a parent, or a partner: we must mourn the loss as if it was our own.",

Beginning with Robert Carter, the planter who freed his slaves in 1791, some Virginians of Jefferson\u2019s class recognized that the blight of slavery had to go and did what was within their power by emancipating their slaves.15 More broadly, the politicians of the North were steadily creating a climate in which antislavery rhetoric and sentiment could take root and thrive.16 The very fact of the debate over Missouri suggested that the antislavery forces were gathering strength\u2014and were willing to use it. As important for a sophisticate such as Jefferson was the French view of the institution.

Moses Hemmenway, who had become a Congregational minister known for his interminable sermons, would remain, in Adams\u2019s estimate, one of the first scholars of their generation.

Every drop was frozen wherever it fell in the trees, and clung to the limbs and sprigs as if it had been fastened by hooks of steel. The earth was never more universally covered with snow, and the rain had frozen upon a crust on the surface which shone with the brightness of burnished silver. The icicles on every sprig glowed in all the luster of diamonds. Every tree was a chandelier of cut glass.

The nullification doctrine would enable a state to void a federal law within its borders. The federal government then had two choices: either leave the state alone or amend the Constitution (which required the approval of two thirds of each house of Congress or a constitutional convention called by two thirds of the states, and then ratification by three fourths of the states) to make the objectionable law explicitly constitutional. And what if the amendment passed? The nullifying state must then capitulate or secede from the Union.",

Yet he was euphoric over a vote on a resolution that could have only the most marginal effect on events. What moved him so deeply was the applause, the earnest handshakes from colleagues, the sense of having brought his colleagues around. Clay had done as much, he conceded, but never against such odds. Clay was a natural leader of men. Adams was not; he was a solitary man who had learned to pay the terrible price of the lonely stand. Perhaps no one else could have felt such vindication at the discovery that he had the power to bring other men along. Adams\u2019 joy was a measure of the depth of his self-imposed isolation.",

He had agreed to take part in a stage show for servicemen held at the Washington Press Club\u2019s canteen. He was playing an upright piano, to an audience of about eight hundred men in uniform, when actress Lauren Bacall, also part of the entertainment, was boosted on top of the piano to strike a leggy pose as the delighted crowd cheered and flashbulbs popped. \u201cI was just a kid,\u201d she would remember. \u201cMy press agent made me do it.\u201d \u201cAnything can happen in this country,\u201d a soldier was quoted at the time. The photographs of the Vice President serenading the glamorous Hollywood star were an instant sensation. What disturbed many people was that Truman appeared to be having such a good time, which he was. Bess was furious. She told him he should play the piano in public no more.",

At one point Truman himself played Paderewski\u2019s Minuet in G, the piece Paderewski had demonstrated for him in Kansas City forty-five years earlier. But the highlight was Sergeant List\u2019s performance of the Chopin Waltz in A Minor, Opus 42, which Truman had asked for specifically. List had not known the piece nor had there been time to learn it. Later, in a letter to his wife, he described what happened when he asked if someone in the audience would be good enough to turn the pages of the music for him.",

With the outcome no longer in doubt, neither grandmaster would have felt the need to play to the end. Foreseeing that his king was soon to be checkmated, the Japanese player would have laid it down on the board and shaken hands with his opponent. But this was war, not a board game, and conditions in Japan did not allow for the possibility of a negotiated truce until long after defeat had become inevitable. Another 1.5 million Japanese servicemen and civilians were to be sacrificed, like so many pawns, before the checkmate in August 1945. Those 1.5 million deaths, in the final year of the conflict, represented nearly one-half of the total Japanese killed in the wars of Asia and the Pacific from 1937 to 1945.88",

                "text": "Underlying these achievements was a foundation built on enormous talent, but equally important, on a disciplined, almost terrifyingly comprehensive effort as a young man to teach himself all of known physics. During the period in which he laid down this awe-inspiring foundation, he also developed a unique way of thinking about problems that allowed him to achieve what he did and to inspire those around him. He learned at an early age how to strip a problem to its essentials and structure the solution in a straightforward manner, invariably starting at the right place and avoiding complications that might bedevil others. He used this technique in a wide variety of settings, notably in solving problems that now bear his name. \u201cFermi problems\u201d can be simplified into a finite set of variables whose values can be estimated to within an order of magnitude. Linking those variables together not only provides a quick, rough-and-ready solution but also forces one to think about the elements of the problem that are essential and those that can be safely discarded. Fermi problems often have at their core estimates of the probability of one event or another occurring. This was the type of problem that Fermi excelled in solving, in part because during that formative period of his intellectual development he mastered probability and statistics as a central part of his scientific repertoire. Calculations of probabilities run like a bright thread throughout his work and at several crucial points in his career provided a focus for his most important breakthroughs\u2014the Fermi-Dirac statistics, for example, or his later fascination with Monte Carlo simulations. This way of thinking, which he passed along to colleagues and students, is one of his greatest legacies. Recruiters at firms like McKinsey and Goldman Sachs pepper potential hires with Fermi problems to see how they think and probably never realize the debt they owe to this giant of modern physics. Fermi\u2019s ability to grind out solutions to difficult problems using a well-developed toolkit of techniques was paired with an extraordinary sense of what problems were important and an affinity for the quick-and-dirty solution when appropriate to his needs. The former set him apart from most of his contemporaries and ensured that he would be at the forefront of his field throughout his career. The latter was sometimes misinterpreted as laziness or, worse yet, a fear of complex mathematics. He was neither lazy nor afraid\u2014he had enormous reserves of energy that drove him to work longer and harder than many younger colleagues, and he was a fine mathematician, able to hold his own with geniuses like John von Neumann\u2014but he valued his time and chose to work only hard enough to get a practical solution. He once quipped to his daughter, Nella, \u201cNever make something more accurate than necessary.\u201d Offered in the context of some unattractive but functional carpentry for the living room of the family home, it was a philosophy\u2026",

His name was Franco Rasetti. Born in a small village in Umbria near the town of Castiglione del Lago, Rasetti was about six weeks older than Fermi, but in appearance he could not have been more different. Tall and beanpole thin, with a scrawny neck and bony face, he gave the impression of a human ostrich. He was close to his mother, and when Rasetti was admitted to university the whole family moved to Pisa, where they lived together in an apartment in town. Rasetti was a true eccentric. He initially chose physics as a subject for university study because, he later explained, it was not a science that involved memorization and classification and would thus be a challenge for him. But in fact he had an extraordinary memory and focused it on classification projects in marine biology and botany; he was able to identify thousands of different species of mollusks and flowers. In later years he would turn from physics to biology as his primary field of study.",

One senses that this notebook, and all subsequent ones, served as his way of internalizing a deep foundational knowledge of physics that he carried with him for the rest of his life.

Whereas knowledge of probability is essential to an understanding of most of modern physics, in and of itself it is not a field on which many physicists focus. Fermi loved to gamble, particularly on the outcome of his own athletic competitions. He also loved to pose riddles that required an understanding of probability. His way of solving problems, now known as Fermi problems, often consisted of evaluating the probabilities of particular events, to at least an order of magnitude, and linking those probabilities together to arrive at a solution that seemed reasonable. The so-called Fermi paradox\u2014Fermi\u2019s back-of-the-envelope observation that if intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe we should have been visited by it long ago, given the size and age of the universe\u2014is in itself a study in probability. One possible reason probability and statistics captivated him may stem from the trauma of Giulio\u2019s death. Here was something unexpected, totally improbable, and yet it occurred, with devastating results. Perhaps the experience awoke within Fermi a desire to understand, delimit, and prepare to the extent possible for events that were out of one\u2019s control. The odds were low that Giulio would die when he did and yet it happened. Fermi may have taken away from this trauma the need to understand the likelihood of any particular event and a feeling that in understanding that probability he was in a better position to anticipate it, prepare for it, and perhaps even shape its outcome. We will, of course, never know. What we do know is that the study of probability ran like a thread through his career and was at the root of many of his most important contributions.",

Now a theory on the ideal gas that is practical [sic] identical to yours was published by me at the beginning of 1926.\u2026 Since I suppose you have not seen my paper, I beg to attract your attention to it. Contrary to Fermi\u2019s presumption, Dirac had indeed read Fermi\u2019s paper. He had simply forgotten it. As he later explained: When I looked through Fermi\u2019s paper, I remembered that I had seen it previously, but I had completely forgotten it. I am afraid it is a failing of mine that my memory is not very good and something is likely to slip out of my mind completely, if at the time I do not see its importance. At the time I read Fermi\u2019s paper, I did not see how it could be important for any of the basic problems of quantum theory; it was so much a detached piece of work. It had completely slipped out of my mind, and when I wrote up my work on the antisymmetric wave functions, I had no recollection of it at all. He immediately sent an apology to Fermi and from then on always referred to the statistics as Fermi-Dirac, generously giving Fermi primary credit for it. That we now refer to particles that obey the exclusion principle as fermions and those that do not as bosons is a direct result of Dirac\u2019s acceptance of Fermi\u2019s claim of priority.",

Some five of his direct students went on to win Nobel Prizes: Chamberlain, Friedman, Lee, Segr\u00e8, and Steinberger. Two others, Cronin and Yang, also won Nobel Prizes and though not formally Fermi students, both credit him with providing career-enhancing inspiration and guidance. Many others went on to prominent and important careers in the field. It is an astonishing record, comparable perhaps only to that of Sommerfeld and Rutherford. Valentine Telegdi judges Fermi\u2019s teaching to be his greatest contribution in the Chicago period. It is difficult to argue with him.",

Ten days before his death he told me \u2018I hope it won\u2019t take too long.\u2019 He reconciled himself perfectly to his fate.\u201d Others had the same impression and remarked on his stoicism. Back from his summer in France, Ulam visited Fermi several times, once with fellow Los Alamos colleague Nick Metropolis. On one of these occasions Fermi discussed his impending death with scientific detachment. True to his essential character, Fermi calculated the odds of surviving long enough for doctors to discover a cure for him at 100:1, extrapolating from his belief that doctors would certainly discover a cure within twenty years. Ulam and Fermi turned to the idea that future generations, possessed with the cure for many fatal illnesses, might use genetic material to resurrect the dead and cure them. Fermi objected that such techniques would not be able to re-create the memories of former lives. After the final visit with Metropolis, Ulam was moved to tears and recalls quoting Plato\u2019s simple eulogy of Socrates to Metropolis: \u201cThat now is the death of one of the wisest men known.\u201d",

Von Neumann found it impossible to accept that his brilliant mathematical mind would be snuffed out at death. Born a nonobservant Jew and having converted to the Catholic faith to please a fianc\u00e9e who wanted to marry in the church, von Neumann turned to Catholicism as a source of comfort and solace, although it seems to have provided him neither. Fermi, in contrast, accepted with rare equanimity the fact that he would no longer exist, an acceptance in keeping with his generally realistic, perhaps even pessimistic, view of life. For Fermi, science completely replaced the function of religion and he died much as he had lived, without any obvious need for metaphysical or religious speculation on what happens after death. It was enough for Fermi to know that his life would end, that at that moment his unique, extraordinary mind would flicker out, but that his work would live on.",

He was willing to put his family life second to his career, with unhappy consequences. He may even have sacrificed his life, if we believe that his exposure to radiation had any relationship to his ultimate demise. Confidence born of innate ability and a strong foundation, a firm belief in his ability to solve any problem, an instinct for important research, an unshakeable faith in his ability to make others understand, a fascination with the role of probability and chance at the core of how the world works, the willingness to make enormous sacrifices for science\u2014all these made Fermi who he was and contributed to his ability to make a lasting impact. Like all of us, however, scientists are prisoners of the era into which they are born. To have had the impact of Einstein, it helped to be born during a period when some of the deepest problems of physics had come to the fore. If Einstein had been born a century earlier, he may have achieved much, but certainly nothing of the magnitude of general relativity. It was Fermi\u2019s great good fortune to have been born during a period in which the quantum revolution was unfolding.",

Imagine, he said, a group of workers faced with the problem of assembling a very large, very complex jigsaw puzzle.103 How could they organize themselves to do the job most efficiently? Each worker could take some of the pieces from the pile and try to fit them together. That would be an efficient method if assembling a puzzle was like shelling peas. But it wasn\u2019t. The pieces weren\u2019t isolated. They fitted together into a whole. And the chance of any one worker\u2019s collection of pieces fitting together was small. Even if the group made enough copies of the pieces to give every worker the entire puzzle to attack, no one would accomplish as much alone as the group might if it could contrive a way to work together. The best way to do the job, Polanyi argued, was to allow each worker to keep track of what every other worker was doing. \u201cLet them work on putting the puzzle together in the sight of the others, so that every time a piece of it is fitted in by one [worker], all the others will immediately watch out for the next step that becomes possible in consequence.\u201d",

On November 8, 1895, one month after Rutherford arrived at Cambridge, the German physicist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered X rays radiating from the fluorescing glass wall of a cathode-ray tube. R\u00f6ntgen reported his discovery in December and stunned the world. The strange radiation was a new growing point for science and Thomson began studying it almost immediately. At the same time he also continued his experiments with cathode rays, experiments that would culminate in 1897 in his identification of what he called the \u201cnegative corpuscle\u201d\u2014the electron, the first atomic particle to be identified. He must have needed help. He would also have understood the extraordinary opportunity for original research that radiation offered a young man of Rutherford\u2019s skill at experiment.",

Long before it can complete that service the bow bends down toward the Austrian Alps, but a border region of mountainous uplift, the Sudetes, continues across Czechoslovakia. Some sixty miles beyond Prague it turns southwest to form a low range between Czechoslovakia and Germany that is called, in German, the Erzgebirge: the Ore Mountains. The Erzgebirge began to be mined for iron in medieval days. In 1516 a rich silver lode was discovered in Joachimsthal (St. Joachim\u2019s dale), in the territory of the Count von Schlick, who immediately appropriated the mine. In 1519 coins were first struck from its silver at his command. Joachimsthaler, the name for the new coins, shortened to thaler, became \u201cdollar\u201d in English before 1600. Thereby the U.S. dollar descends from the silver of Joachimsthal.",

To acquire it, hydrogen atoms packed together in a nucleus sacrifice some of their mass. This mass defect is what Aston found when he compared the hydrogen atom to the atoms of other elements following his whole-number rule. In addition, he said, nuclei may be more or less loosely packed. The density of their packing requires more or less binding energy, and that in turn requires more or less mass: hence the small variations. The difference between the measured mass and the whole number he expressed as a fraction, the packing fraction: roughly, the divergence of an element from its whole number divided by its whole number. \u201cHigh packing fractions,\u201d Aston proposed, \u201cindicate looseness of packing, and therefore low stability: low packing fractions the reverse.\u201d517 He plotted the packing fractions on a graph and demonstrated that the elements in the broad middle of the periodic table\u2014nickel, iron, tin, for example\u2014had the lowest packing fractions and were therefore the most stable, while elements at the extremes of the periodic table\u2014hydrogen at the light end, for example, uranium at the heavy\u2014had high packing fractions and were therefore the most unstable. Locked within all the elements, he said, but most unstably so in the case of those with high packing fractions, was mass converted to energy. Comparing helium to hydrogen, nearly 1 percent of the hydrogen mass was missing (4 divided by 4.032 = .992 = 99.2%). \u201cIf we were able to transmute [hydrogen] into [helium] nearly 1 percent of the mass would be annihilated. On the relativity equivalence of mass and energy now experimentally proved [Aston refers here to Einstein\u2019s famous equation E = mc2], the quantity of energy liberated would be prodigious. Thus to change the hydrogen in a glass of water into helium would release enough energy to drive the \u2018Queen Mary\u2019 across the Atlantic and back at full speed.\u201d518",

What you say is true: I do value it\u2014and I think that you do too\u2014more than for its earthly fruit, proficiency. I think that one can give only a metaphysical ground for this evaluation; but the variety of metaphysics which gave an answer to your question has been very great, the metaphysics themselves very disparate: the bhagavad gita, Ecclesiastes, the Stoa, the beginning of the Laws, Hugo of St Victor, St Thomas, John of the Cross, Spinoza. This very great disparity suggests that the fact that discipline is good for the soul is more fundamental than any of the grounds given for its goodness. I believe that through discipline, though not through discipline alone, we can achieve serenity, and a certain small but precious measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation, and charity, and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces. I believe that through discipline we can learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances, and to abandon with simplicity what would else have seemed to us indispensable; that we come a little to see the world without the gross distortion of personal desire, and in seeing it so, accept more easily our earthly privation and its",

This was hurriedly relayed to Fermi who resented having communicated a result which now looked to be in error. He strongly criticized us and did not conceal his displeasure. The whole business was becoming very troublesome because we could not find any fault with the various experiments which gave inconsistent results.816 The chastened junior members had their work cut out for them. A new recruit joined them, a tall, broad-shouldered, handsome tennis champion from Pisa named Bruno Pontecorvo, as they set about polishing their first rough work. Neutron bombardment activated some elements more intensely than others. They had previously categorized that activation only generally as strong, medium or weak. Now they proposed to establish a quantitative scale of activibility. They needed some standard intensity against which to measure the intensity of other activations. They chose the convenient 2.3-minute half-life period that neutron bombardment induced in silver. Amaldi and Pontecorvo got the assignment. They immediately found, to their surprise, that their silver cylinders activated differently in different parts of the laboratory. \u201cIn particular,\u201d writes Amaldi, \u201cthere were certain wooden tables near a spectroscope in a dark room which had miraculous properties, since silver irradiated on those tables gained much more activity than when it was irradiated on a marble table in the same room.\u201d817 That was a mystery worth exploring. On October 18 they started a systematic investigation, a series of measurements made inside and outside a lead housing. By October 22 they were prepared to measure what might happen when only a lead wedge separated the neutron source from its target. But the experimenters had to give student examinations that morning and Fermi decided to go ahead on his own. He described the historic moment late in life to a colleague curious about the process of discovery in physics: I will tell you how I came to make the discovery which I suppose is the most important one I have made. We were working very hard on the neutron-induced radioactivity and the results we were obtaining made no sense. One day, as I came into the laboratory, it occurred to me that I should examine the effect of placing a piece of lead before the incident neutrons. Instead of my usual custom, I took great pains to have the piece of lead precisely machined. I was clearly dissatisfied with something: I tried every excuse to postpone putting the piece of lead in its place. When finally, with some reluctance, I was going to put it in its place, I said to myself: \u201cNo, I do not want this piece of lead here; what I want is a piece of paraffin.\u201d It was just like that with no advance warning, no conscious prior reasoning. I immediately took some odd piece of paraffin and placed\u2026",

When he returned in midafternoon he proposed an answer: the neutrons were colliding with the hydrogen nuclei in the paraffin and the wood. That slowed them down. Everyone had assumed that faster neutrons were better for nuclear bombardment because faster protons and alpha particles always had been better. But the analogy ignored the neutron\u2019s distinctive neutrality. A charged particle needed energy to push through the nucleus\u2019 electrical barrier. A neutron did not. Slowing down a neutron gave it more time in the vicinity of the nucleus, and that gave it more time to be captured.",

At school he wore gray suits, blue shirts and well-polished black shoes.

Everybody certainly had the impression that Oppenheimer cared what each particular person was doing.

I don\u2019t remember any occasion at Los Alamos in which he was nasty to any person, whereas before and after the war he was often that way.

He may have discovered there a process of self-analysis anchored in complementarity that served him more comprehensively later in his life: \u201cIn an attempt to break out and be a reasonable man, I had to realize that my own worries about what I did were valid and were important, but that they were not the whole story, that there must be a complementary way of looking at them, because other people did not see them as I did.2146 And I needed what they saw, and needed them.\u201d Certainly he found the more traditional alleviation of losing himself in work.",

                "text": "But he did read a book that appears to have resulted in an epiphany. The book was Marcel Proust\u2019s A La Recherche du Temps Perdu, a mystical and existential text that spoke to Oppenheimer\u2019s troubled soul. Reading it in the evening by flashlight during his walking tour of Corsica, he later claimed to his Berkeley friend Haakon Chevalier, was one of the great experiences of his life. It snapped him out of his depression. Proust\u2019s work is a classic novel of introspection, and it left a deep and lasting impression on Oppenheimer. More than a decade after he first read Proust, Oppenheimer startled Chevalier by quoting from memory a passage in Volume One that discusses cruelty: Perhaps she would not have considered evil to be so rare, so extraordinary, so estranging a state, to which it was so restful to emigrate, had she been able to discern in herself, as in everyone, that indifference to the sufferings one causes, an indifference which, whatever other names one may give it, is the terrible and permanent form of cruelty. As a young man in Corsica, Robert no doubt memorized these words precisely because he saw in himself an indifference to the sufferings he caused others. It was a painful insight. One can only speculate about a man\u2019s inner life, but perhaps seeing an expression of his own dark and guilt-laden thoughts in print somehow lightened Robert\u2019s psychological burden. It had to be comforting to know that he was not alone, that this was part of the human condition. He no longer need despise himself; he could love. And perhaps it was also reassuring, particularly for an intellectual, that Robert could tell himself that it was a book\u2014and not a psychiatrist\u2014which had helped to wrench him from the black hole of his depression.",

In the spring of 1932, Robert wrote his brother a long letter explaining why. The fact that discipline, he argued, \u201cis good for the soul is more fundamental than any of the grounds given for its goodness. I believe that through discipline, though not through discipline alone, we can achieve serenity, and a certain small but precious measure of freedom from the accidents of incarnation . . . and that detachment which preserves the world which it renounces. I believe that through discipline we learn to preserve what is essential to our happiness in more and more adverse circumstances, and to abandon with simplicity what would else have seemed to us indispensable.\u201d And only through discipline is it possible \u201cto see the world without the gross distortion of personal desire, and in seeing it so, accept more easily our earthly privation and its earthly horror.\u201d",

I am not talking about knowledge, but about being limited by what you can do. . . . There is no meaningful responsibility without power. It may be only power over what you do yourself\u2014but increased knowledge, increased wealth, leisure are all increasing the domain in which responsibility is conceivable.\u201d After this soliloquy, Morgan wrote, \u201cOppenheimer then turned his palms up, the long, slender fingers including his listener in his conclusion. \u2018You and I,\u2019 he said, \u2018neither of us is rich. But as far as responsibility goes, we are both in a position right now to alleviate the most awful agony in people at the starvation level.\u201d This was only a different way of saying what he had learned from reading Proust forty years earlier in Corsica: that \u201cindifference to the sufferings one causes . . . is the terrible and permanent form of cruelty.\u201d Far from being indifferent, Robert was acutely aware of the suffering he had caused others in his life\u2014and yet he would not allow himself to succumb to guilt. He would accept responsibility; he had never tried to deny his responsibility. But since the security hearing, he nevertheless no longer seemed to have the capacity or motivation to fight against the \u201ccruelty\u201d of indifference.

It\u2019s great, but I don\u2019t know if what you\u2019re saying is really possible.\u201d I resisted these voices. I resisted precisely because I feared they were right. Whatever I was incubating during those hours spent alone, whatever vision for a better world I\u2019d let flourish in the hothouse of my youthful mind, it could hardly withstand even a simple conversational road test. In the gray light of a Manhattan winter and against the overarching cynicism of the times, my ideas, spoken aloud in class or over coffee with friends, came off as fanciful and far-fetched. And I knew it. In fact, it\u2019s one of the things that may have saved me from becoming a full-blown crank before I reached the age of twenty-two; at some basic level I understood the absurdity of my vision, how wide the gap was between my grand ambitions and anything I was actually doing in my life.

But I wondered now if I could ever really escape whatever it was in me that needed healing, whatever kept me reaching for more. Maybe it was impossible to disentangle one\u2019s motives. I recalled a sermon by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called \u201cThe Drum Major Instinct.\u201d In it, he talks about how, deep down, we all want to be first, celebrated for our greatness; we all want \u201cto lead the parade.\u201d He goes on to point out that such selfish impulses can be reconciled by aligning that quest for greatness with more selfless aims. You can strive to be first in service, first in love. For me, it seemed a satisfying way to square the circle when it came to one\u2019s baser and higher instincts. Except now I was also confronting the obvious fact that the sacrifices were never mine alone. Family got dragged along for the ride, put in the line of fire. Dr. King\u2019s cause, and his gifts, might have justified such sacrifice. But could mine?",

I didn\u2019t see him often but was coming to realize that the two of us had much in common. We were both analytical and even-keeled, generally skeptical of convention and pretense. But whereas I could be absentminded, indifferent to small details, incapable of maintaining an orderly filing system, constantly misplacing memos, pens, and cell phones that had just been handed to me, Plouffe turned out to be a managerial genius. From the start, he focused unapologetically and unswervingly on winning Iowa. Even when cable pundits and some of our supporters were calling us idiots for being so single-minded, he wouldn\u2019t let anyone waver an inch from the strategy, certain it was our only path to victory. Plouffe imposed a martial discipline, giving everyone on our team\u2014from Axe to our most junior organizer\u2014a level of autonomy while also demanding accountability and a strict adherence to process. He capped salaries as a way of eliminating needless staff dissent. He pointedly directed resources away from bloated consulting contracts and media budgets in order to give our field organizers what they needed on the ground. Obsessive about data, he recruited a team of internet savants who designed a digital program that was light-years ahead of those not just of other campaigns but many private corporations as well. Add it all up, and in six months, from a standing start, Plouffe built a campaign operation strong enough to go toe-to-toe with the Clinton machine. It was a fact he quietly relished. This was another thing I came to realize about Plouffe: Beneath the low-key persona and deep convictions, he just plain liked the combat. Politics was his sport, and in his chosen endeavor he was as competitive as Reggie was in basketball. Later, I\u2019d ask Axe if he\u2019d anticipated just how good a campaign architect his then junior partner would turn out to be. Axe shook his head.",

Berries may compete to be eaten more than animals compete for the berries. A thorn acacia makes sugary protein treats to feed and enslave the ants who guard it. Fruit-bearing plants trick us into distributing their seeds, and ripening fruit led to color vision. In teaching us how to find their bait, trees taught us to see that the sky is blue. Our brains evolved to solve the forest. We\u2019ve shaped and been shaped by forests for longer than we\u2019ve been Homo sapiens. \u201cMen and trees are closer cousins than you think.

Running a billion field tests. They make their conjectures, and the living world tells them what works. Life is speculation, and speculation is life. What a marvelous word! It means to guess.

If we could understand green, we\u2019d learn how to grow all the food we need in layers three deep, on a third of the ground we need right now, with plants that protected one another from pests and stress.

First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. How did you answer the question of what you wanted to be when you grew up? The specific answer you gave may have been off the mark, but the underlying impulse was not. If you wanted to be a fireman, what did a fireman mean to you? A good man who rescued people in distress? A daredevil? Or the simple pleasure of operating a truck? If you wanted to be a dancer, was it because you got to wear a costume, or because you craved applause, or was it the pure joy of twirling around at lightning speed? You may have known more about who you were then than you do now. Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to.",

Therefore, if you\u2019re in a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone\u2019s q value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market.",

The goal of this chapter is to explain this paradox. The rareness of deep work, I\u2019ll argue, is not due to some fundamental weakness of the habit. When we look closer at why we embrace distraction in the workplace we\u2019ll find the reasons are more arbitrary than we might expect\u2014based on flawed thinking combined with the ambiguity and confusion that often define knowledge work. My objective is to convince you that although our current embrace of distraction is a real phenomenon, it\u2019s built on an unstable foundation and can be easily dismissed once you decide to cultivate a deep work ethic.",

During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically\u2014seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches (as many academics do over the summer or while on sabbatical).",

This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach. At the same time, the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking. The approach of shifting between two modes provides a way to serve both needs well.",

In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you\u2019re ultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: \u201cWhen you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.\u201d Lead measures, on the other hand, \u201cmeasure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.\u201d In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well. In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.",

The authors of this study, led by the Dutch psychologist Ap Dijksterhuis, set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. In other words, to actively try to work through these decisions will lead to a worse outcome than loading up the relevant information and then moving on to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your mind mull things over.",

Morris used Roosevelt\u2019s diary and letters from this period to estimate that the future president was spending no more than a quarter of the typical day studying. One might expect therefore that Roosevelt\u2019s grades would crater. But they didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t the top student in his class, but he certainly didn\u2019t struggle either: In his freshman year he earned honor grades in five out of his seven courses. The explanation for this Roosevelt paradox turns out to be his unique approach to tackling this schoolwork. Roosevelt would begin his scheduling by considering the eight hours from eight thirty a.m. to four thirty p.m. He would then remove the time spent in recitation and classes, his athletic training (which was once a day), and lunch. The fragments that remained were then considered time dedicated exclusively to studying. As noted, these fragments didn\u2019t usually add up to a large number of total hours, but he would get the most out of them by working only on schoolwork during these periods, and doing so with a blistering intensity. \u201cThe amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small,\u201d explained Morris, \u201cbut his concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off [from schoolwork] than most.\u201d",

Even the instructions he left for his funeral reflected this: \u201cBury me simply, like any ordinary officer of the U.S. Army who has served his country honorably. No fuss\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. And above everything, do it quietly.\u201d5 Like most of the World War II generals, he could have made a fortune writing an autobiography or memoir. He declined all offers, preferring to let the record he left behind speak for him. Marshall abhorred any activity that attracted attention to himself. And he certainly did not want to offend or embarrass any of the people he had associated with during his decades of service.",

Marshall\u2019s anger was bubbling to the surface. As one of his aides remembered, when Marshall was angry, \u201chis eyes flashed and he talked so rapidly and vehemently no one else could get in a word.\u201d38 For the next few minutes, Marshall crisply ticked off several reasons why the division\u2019s training progress had been inhibited, aiming much of the blame at Pershing\u2019s own headquarters staff. With impertinence, Marshall looked directly at Pershing and said, \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ve gotten out was to change the name of the dump\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. and now you are criticizing us for the names you changed.\u201d Pershing\u2019s chief of staff tried to brush him off, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll look into it.\u201d Marshall shot back, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look into it.\u201d Pointing to a packet of papers, he continued, \u201cIt\u2019s right here in the orders. It is a fact.\u201d \u201cI was just mad all over,\u201d recalled Marshall. He went on to drive home one final point. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked very, very hard. The men have had no advantages and they don\u2019t expect any. But they ought to get a fair deal at any rate.\u201d To this, Pershing could only say, \u201cWell, you must appreciate the troubles we have.\u201d \u201cYes, again, General,\u201d Marshall responded, \u201cbut we have them every day and many a day and we have to solve every one of them by night.\u201d The encounter was over. Marshall\u2019s \u201cbosom friends\u201d believed his career \u201cwas finished,\u201d and he\u2019d \u201cbe fired right off.\u201d39 To the contrary, Pershing\u2014who was not offended by constructive criticism\u2014was impressed. For Marshall\u2019s career this turned out to be a pivotal encounter. His courage in speaking truth to power caused Pershing to confer even more power and authority on him. The general began to seek Marshall\u2019s advice, pulling him aside to discuss privately matters of training, strategy, and troop morale. In early January 1918, Marshall was promoted to lieutenant colonel (temporary). Throughout winter and into spring, private sessions between the two became more frequent, their relationship deepening. Marshall had encountered no other superior officer with whom he \u201ccould be frank to the degree\u201d he could with General Pershing.40",

The second most important lesson was a sense of the qualities he would look for in promoting officers to lead troops in the next war. As listed in a letter Marshall wrote in November 1920, they include common sense, physical strength, marked energy, determination, and cheerful optimism.58 The emphasis on physical strength and energy meant that many if not most older officers would have to be passed over or retired. Marshall valued character over intellect, conservatism over flamboyance, and the loyal team-player over the adventurous individualist. He avoided yes-men and conformists, preferring those who, like Pershing and himself, were unafraid to express dissent and open to criticism without taking offense.",

Scheduled for the week of January 16 was his annual physical examination, the results of which would be read by Malin Craig and President Roosevelt. The problem was his heart. Even a mild defect could doom his ambition to be chief of staff. Since 1936, Marshall had experienced an irregularity in his pulse\u2014heart arrhythmia. In February 1937, surgeons at the Letterman Hospital in San Francisco removed his swollen thyroid, which was thought to be causing the arrhythmia. Within a few months his pulse was normal, although he was careful to take catnaps during the day. The only person other than Katherine who Marshall told about the operation and his heart condition was Colonel Morrison Stayer, the army doctor whom he had befriended in China and who treated him privately during his years at Fort Benning and thereafter. When Marshall\u2019s episodes of arrhythmia began recurring in the fall of 1938, he turned to Stayer, knowing he would soon have to pass a physical. The two men secretly devised a scheme whereby Marshall was to begin ingesting an undisclosed medication prescribed by Stayer a week before the physical in order to obscure the pulse irregularity.24",

Unlike Marshall and her husband, Madame Chiang was outgoing and garrulous, born to extraordinary wealth. Eleven years younger than Chiang, she was attractive and sexy, almost always wearing makeup and a traditional qi pao dress that was slit to the knee and sometimes above. Soong Mayling was a Christian, a devout Methodist, who had been educated in America, first at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, then at Wellesley in Massachusetts so she could be close to her brother, T. V. Soong, who was at Harvard. She spoke perfect English with a Georgia accent. Mayling and Kai-shek were known throughout the world as symbols of Chinese bravery and dignity. She spent the last fourteen months of the war living on the Long Island estate of H. H. Kung, supposedly a direct descendant of Confucius, who was married to her sister Ai-ling (her other sister, Ching-ling, was the widow of Sun Yat-sen).

He asked Acheson to create a new section within the State Department to be called the Policy Planning Staff. According to Acheson, Marshall conceived that the function of the group would be to \u201clook far enough ahead to see the emerging form of things to come and outline what should be done to meet or anticipate them.\u201d5 Marshall\u2019s first choice to become head of the new Policy Planning Staff was forty-three-year-old George Frost Kennan. He was aware that Kennan was regarded as America\u2019s foremost expert on the Soviet Union. When Marshall was in China, he read several of Kennan\u2019s dispatches from the American Embassy in Moscow, including the \u201clong telegram,\u201d probably the most influential analysis of Soviet postwar intentions that has ever been written. Kennan dictated the 5,540-word telegram from his upstairs bedroom at the embassy, while suffering from \u201ccold, fever, sinus and tooth trouble.\u201d6 The telegram was wired to the State Department and circulated to Kennan\u2019s superiors at State, the Pentagon, and the White House. Navy Secretary James Forrestal, a fellow Princetonian, became Kennan\u2019s Washington evangelist, distributing copies throughout the capital and assuring that Kennan\u2019s message was read.

Like the czars before them, Kennan wrote, Soviet autocrats hold paranoid beliefs that surrounding nations are perpetually hostile. For them, expansion into neighboring territories is a \u201cstrategic necessity.\u201d Marxist dogma, Kennan argued, was no more than an ideological \u201cfig leaf\u201d that Russian rulers use as a vehicle to guarantee the survival of their \u201cinternally weak regimes.\u201d Kennan explained that the Soviet regime operates on two levels, one visible that consists of its official actions, and the other invisible\u2014\u201csubterranean\u201d\u2014for which the rulers accept no responsibility. Foreshadowing the twenty-first-century electoral hacking allegations, Kennan noted that Russia\u2019s invisible operatives seek to undermine Western powers by disrupting \u201cnational self confidence,\u201d increasing \u201csocial unrest,\u201d and stimulating \u201call forms of disunity.\u201d To cope with Soviet intentions \u201cis undoubtedly the greatest task our diplomacy has ever faced,\u201d he wrote. However, it \u201cis within our power to solve\u201d\u2014and without recourse to war. The proper policy, he counseled, is vigilance, a show of force without risking a showdown, a healthy economy, and the provision of a protective umbrella of security to European nations emerging from the devastation of the war.7 In essence it was a policy of \u201ccontainment,\u201d though Kennan would not use that word until more than a year later when he drafted an eloquent restatement of the long telegram that was published anonymously under the name \u201cX\u201d in Foreign Affairs.8 Marshall had the 1946 long telegram in mind when he decided during his first few days as secretary of state that Kennan was his first choice to lead the Policy Planning Staff. Marshall\u2019s decision was bolstered by the strong recommendations of James Forrestal and Beetle Smith, who had taken over from Averell Harriman as the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. From Moscow, Smith sent a letter to Marshall saying that he \u201cknew all of the Russian experts, here and in Washington, and they are all good, but Kennan is head and shoulders above the lot\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d9 On January 24, Acheson, at the request of Marshall, asked Kennan whether he would be willing to lead the new Policy Planning Staff at State. Kennan, who had been recalled to Washington to teach at the National War College, accepted the offer, but due to commitments at the War College he could not report for duty until the spring. Thus, only three days after he was sworn in, Marshall established a policy organization and he hired a brilliant expert on the Soviet Union to run it. These moves\u2014a management change and a personnel choice\u2014proved to be two of the most important decisions he would make as secretary of state.",

He later observed, with worthy candor, \u201cLooking at myself objectively, I think I am a good judge of men; and I know that I tend to be lazy about many things, so I do not try to do anything that I can pass down the line to someone more competent than I am to do it.\u201d66 Carl Moore would have agreed with the entirety of that judgment. Spruance did not micromanage; he picked good men, gave them authority, and held them accountable. He never failed to grasp the data he needed to render major decisions, but once those decisions were made, he dismissed from his mind the details of their execution. By refusing to absorb himself in such particulars, he kept his mind clear to consider the broadest problems of strategy and organization. Plausibly, Spruance did not need to work as hard as others because he possessed the sort of mind that took in and processed information more rapidly. Ernest King, who was no simpleton, attested that Spruance \u201cwas in intellectual ability unsurpassed among the flag officers of the United States Navy.\u201d67 His distinction as a seagoing commander, at the Battle of Midway in 1942 and with the Fifth Fleet later in the war, would seem to vindicate his hands-off approach.",

Appended to the narrative history was a description of the battle monuments that had been erected and the locations of the various cemeteries where American war dead were buried. The purpose was to provide an easily accessible reference work for Americans who might visit France, and Eisenhower was given a six-month deadline. To call A Guide to the American Battle Fields in Europe simply a tourist guidebook trivializes the undertaking.3 It is a guidebook. But more important, it is a complete history, battle by battle, of the American war on the western front. Of the 282 pages, roughly a third are devoted to describing the battlefield monuments; the remaining two hundred pages provide a concise summary of the fighting, beginning with Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry and Belleau Wood in June 1918 and concluding with the armistice in November. The book is written from the vantage point of Pershing\u2019s headquarters, and in describing the fighting Eisenhower presents the details with remarkable clarity.",

It is difficult to imagine a more useful assignment for a future supreme commander than to write a history of the analogous American effort in World War I. In 1927 a second war in Europe was scarcely on the horizon, and Eisenhower often chafed under the tight deadlines Pershing imposed. But the substantive knowledge of the war in France that he derived from the exercise surely stood him in good stead when he commanded the Allied effort seventeen years later.",

He had no tolerance for failure.\u201d18 The same could be said for General Marshall, who was even more demanding. With Ike, there was the occasional burst of humor to lighten the load; with Marshall it was all business, all the time. The men were also similar in bearing and appearance. They wore neatly tailored uniforms with a minimum of ornamentation. Both were six feet tall, slender but muscular, with the loping stride of former athletes. Both were chain smokers. Both knew how to delegate. When they assigned a task, they stepped aside. Subordinates were free to follow whatever course they wished to get the job done. It was the old Army at its best. General Grant would tell a division commander what he wanted done. He would not tell him how to do it. Both Marshall and Eisenhower demanded team players, rejected exhibitionists, and preferred people who could solve problems rather than create them. They expected subordinates to take responsibility, and then backed them to the hilt when they did.",

Georgia, 31 U.S. 515), President Jackson is alleged to have said, \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\u201d Again, the problem is that Jackson never said that. It was concocted by Horace Greeley in 1864 and put in Jackson\u2019s mouth. (Jackson died in 1845.) The story of Eisenhower and Warren is equally bogus.",

When I find myself with an opportunity, I ask myself whether I\u2019d be happy if my epitaph had something to do with this project. If the answer is a clear no, it probably means it\u2019s not actually very important to me. Thinking about your epitaph, as morbid as it is, is a nice way to cut through all the noise and force yourself to look at your work from a super zoomed-out perspective, where you can see what really matters to you. So I try to make my \u201cyes\u201d list by thinking about the Epitaph Test, and potential time commitments outside of that definition fall on my \u201cno\u201d list. For me, the Epitaph Test is usually a reminder to focus my time and effort on doing the highest-quality and most original creative work I can. For my social life \u201cyes\u201d list, a similar test could be called the Deathbed Test. We all hear about these studies where people on their deathbed reflect on what they regret most, and the clich\u00e9 is that nobody ever says they regret spending more time in the office. That\u2019s because a deathbed offers people a level of zoomed-out clarity that\u2019s hard to get to in our normal lives, and it\u2019s only when we\u2019re lacking that clarity in the fog of our day-to-day rush that we\u2019d think it makes sense to neglect our most important personal relationships.",

Bell, John Hendren Bell, superintendent of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, argued for the right to sterilize a woman in his care, eighteen-year-old Carrie Buck, whom he claimed was feeble-minded and promiscuous. The court found in his favor, upholding the state\u2019s right to sterilize developmentally disabled people in institutions. This paved the way for even more sterilizations, often including those of the deaf. It\u2019s estimated that seventy thousand citizens were forcibly sterilized. Soon after Buck v. Bell, Nazi Germany modeled their early sterilization laws after the United States\u2019 legislation. In 1933, Hitler\u2019s cabinet passed the Law for the Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases, which permitted sterilization of disabled people; in 1935, they passed the \u201cLaw for the Protection of Hereditary Health of the German Nation,\u201d requiring that anyone wishing to marry secure a certificate that stated they were free of hereditary disease; ultimately, teachers at deaf schools complied in delivering deaf children to those who would sterilize them. An estimated 40 percent of the total German deaf population was sterilized during the Nazi era. As time went on, disabled citizens in institutions, including the deaf, were permitted to starve to death, and under the 1939 program \u201cOperation T4,\u201d they were systematically murdered.",

I found they did not mind my appointing any man, whether he was a labor man or not, so long as he was not appointed as a labor man,\u201d so long as the appointment somehow fell under one of the five agreed-upon titles. To fill the \u201ceminent sociologist\u201d slot, Roosevelt promptly suggested labor leader E. E. Clark, the head of the Order of Railway Conductors. \u201cI shall never forget the mixture of relief and amusement I felt when I thoroughly grasped the fact that while they would heroically submit to anarchy rather than have Tweedledum, yet if I would call it Tweedledee they would accept with rapture.\u201d At the Wilkes-Barre convention several days later, the miners voted as one to return to work. Headlines blazoned the news: \u201cAnthracite Miners Decide to Have Their Issues and Interests Determined by President\u2019s Commission. New Era Marked in the Affairs of Labor.\u201d Thus, after 163 days of deadlock, the potentially most devastating strike in American history reached a peaceful conclusion. Acting as \u201cthe people\u2019s attorney,\u201d Roosevelt had defined the public interest in the hitherto private struggle between labor and capital. He had waited patiently through five months of the strike, moving one step at a time, until the \u201csteady pressure of public opinion\u201d created space for bringing the two sides together in a first-ever federal binding arbitration. \u201cThe child is born,\u201d Carroll Wright wrote, \u201cand I trust will prove a vigorous\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. member of society.\u201d",

Sometimes his inattention made her fly off the handle. On one occasion as he sat reading in his rocking chair in the living room while she cooked dinner, she warned him that the fire was about to go out. Absorbed in his reading, he did not respond, and she called out again, and then a third time.
